# An Integrated Toolbox for Assessing and Enhancing Urban Resilience to Climate Extremes

## 📖 Introduction
This project aims to develop an integrated computational toolbox to explore climate-biosphere feedback processes and assess urban resilience to climate extremes.

In the context of rapid urbanization and global warming, this toolbox provides a workflow to process climate data, compute extreme indicators, and visualize risks associated with heat stress and extreme rainfall.

## 🚀 Key Features
The toolbox focuses on the following primary objectives:
* **Climate Extreme Indicators (ETCCDI):** Computing indices such as `TXx`, `TNn`, `R95p`, and `PRCPTOT` to assess long-term temperature and rainfall trends.
* **Heat-Stress Metrics:** Calculating human heat exposure metrics like Wet-Bulb Temperature (`Tw`) and Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (`WBGT`).
* **Visualization:** Generating maps, plots, and statistical summaries to identify urban hotspots and support data-driven planning.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
The project is implemented using the **Python** ecosystem with the following key libraries:
* `xarray`, `numpy`, `pandas`: For multi-dimensional data manipulation.
* `matplotlib`: For static plotting and visualization.
* `Dask`: For parallel computing and handling large datasets.
